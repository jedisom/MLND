# Learning from Chinese Learning Data

This repository holds a project that analyzes data from a book in Chinese that I read.  I couldn't really read Chinese before reading this book, so the data documents my Chinese reading learning process.  I digitized the dataset (it was originally a written log) and used supervised learning analysis to determine what features in the text I read could accurately predict my reading speed as I progressed along the Chinese learning experience curve.

##Creating the Dataset
I have 2 spiral bound notebooks that contain the notes I took while reading this Chinese book.  While studying, if I didn't know a Chinese character, I would write the pinyin, English and Chinese character down.  I did this because I thought the repitition would help me learn to recognize the characters, and help me learn to write Chinese characters.  I also started to keep track of the dates I read, the amount of time I spent reading during each study session, and where in the text I started and stopped each day.  This last bit of information was critical; this is how I transformed the hand written notes into a digital dataset.  The Chinese text I read can be found on this [website](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm?lang=zho) (see any applicable copywrite information there).  

Each row of the dataset contains the following fields
- Date: This is the date of the study session
- Time_Spent: This is the time I spent studying on that day in minutes
- Text_Read: This is the text from the book I was able to read during the time I was studying.

##Files Used and Required Packages
###Files
- `Chinese_Learning_Log.xlsx`: This is the raw data file
- `raw_to_tidy.py`: This python script includes functions that turn the raw data file into a tidy dataset for analysis
- `feature_creation.py`: This python script creates new features from the Chinese text to be used as inputs/predictors in the supvervised learning problem
- `supervised_learner.py`: This python script is the master script that calls functions from the other scripts above.  It is also where I implemented the supervised learning algorithms to fit a more accurate model to the dataset.

##Udacity Assignment Guidelines
>###Capstone Project Guidelines
>Use the following questions in each section to keep a mental checklist of if you are meeting the standards and requirements for each rubric item your project is graded against. You can find these questions in their respective sections of the project report template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B-vEOscvfqctGEMHTFDS9Nw7aqcE2iuwPRfp0jK8nf4/pub?embedded=true).
>####Definition
>#####Project Overview
>- Has an overview of the project been provided, such as the problem domain, project origin, and related datasets or input data?
>- Has enough background information been given so that an uninformed reader would understand the problem domain and following problem statement?

>#####Problem Statement
>- Is the problem statement clearly defined? Will the reader understand what you are expecting to solve?
>- Have you thoroughly discussed how you will attempt to solve the problem?
>- Is an anticipated solution clearly defined? Will the reader understand what results you are looking for?

>#####Metrics
>- Are the metrics youâ€™ve chosen to measure the performance of your models clearly discussed and defined?
>- Have you provided reasonable justification for the metrics chosen based on the problem and solution?

>####Results
>#####Model Evaluation and Validation
>- Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?
>- Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?
>- Is the model robust enough for the problem? Do small perturbations (changes) in training data or the input space greatly affect the results?
>- Can results found from the model be trusted?

>#####Justification
>- Are the final results found stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier?
>- Have you thoroughly analyzed and discussed the final solution?
>- Is the final solution significant enough to have solved the problem?

>####Conclusion
>#####Free-Form Visualization
>- Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?
